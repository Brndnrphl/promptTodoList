## Usage

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. You will see a prompt asking "What would you like to do:". Enter one of the following options:
   - `new`: This option allows you to add a new task to the list. You will be prompted to enter the task, and it will be added to the list. You can continue adding tasks until you choose not to add any more.
   - `list`: This option displays all the tasks in the list. Each task is displayed with a number and the task description.
   - `delete`: This option allows you to delete a task from the list. You will be prompted to enter the task you want to delete. If the task is found in the list, it will be removed. Otherwise, you will see a message indicating that the task was not found.
   - `quit`: This option allows you to exit the todolist application.
   - If you enter any other input, you will see an "Invalid input" message.
